This page serves as a central hub linking to some of the web utilities and projects I've built:

* **[Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe](https://aaldrich29.github.io/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/)**: A more complex version of Tic-Tac-Toe with a strategic twist. Built with a retro arcade feel.
* **[Simple QR Code Generator](https://aaldrich29.github.io/simple-qr-code-generator/)**: Generate QR codes easily. Styled with a nostalgic Windows 95 look.
* **[Simple Barbell Plate Calculator](https://aaldrich29.github.io/barbell-plate-calculator/)**: Calculates which plates to load on a barbell for a target weight. Has a 90s vibe.
